    <h2>Minecraft's Main Gameplay</h2>
    <br><br>
    <h3>The Basics</h3>
    <h5>The main focus of Minecraft is to beat the Ender Dragon, which is found in the End Dimension. To start this, you create a new world, and when you spawn in, you will likely see at least 1 tree close to your spawn point. Go up to this tree and hold left click while facing it, this will break the wood logs that you can then craft into wood planks by pressing "e" and dragging said logs to the upper right of your inventory screen to turn them into wood planks. There are a number of recipes in Minecraft, and most of them are accessed through the crafting table, which you can get by taking your wood planks and filling up the crafting menu so you get a crafting table. Once you have your crafting table, always remember to use the right mouse button to interact with the crafting table. After this, you can turn your planks into sticks by simply arranging them in a vertical 1*2 manner on the crafting menu in your inventory or the crafting table. Once you have made your sticks, you can start making tools now. Creating tools may take a bit of getting used to, so Irecommend clicking the green recipe book next to the crafting interface in the crafting table UI so that you can easily craft whatever it is you need. You will only need to create a sword, and axe, and a pickaxe, and put them in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd slots of your hotbar respectively. Once you've made those, you can start mining. Find any small hole in the ground and find some gray stone to mine. You will have to mine 16 stone at most to get both stone tools and a furnace, which I will get to later. Once you have the stone, use 8 of those stones to make stone tools, which are made the same way as wooden ones, only that the planks are replaced with cobblestone. These tools last longer and mine faster than wooden ones. Later you will have to upgrade to iron tools, which are obtained from crafting using iron and sticks like making tools as usual. The iron is gotten from smelting raw iron, which is a brown ore found at areas throughout the map. After this, you should make a shield, which can be crafted by simply searching up "shield" in the crafting recipe book. It requires 6 wood planks of any kind and 1 iron. Once you have your shield, simply drag it to your shield slot in your inventory and now you can defend against mob attacks. To use a shield, press the right mouse button. This will negate all damage from mobs except for mobs wielding axes like the Vindicator, and AOE attacks such as the Ender Dragon's fire breath. From this, it's up to you to build whatever you want, and there are a number of guides on Youtube to help you with finding diamonds, netherite, and many more features like enchanting. Also, if you're a completionist, there are advancements that you can get by looking at the advancements tab in settings by pressing esc.</h5>
