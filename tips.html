    <h2>Tips and Tricks to help with your Gameplay</h2>

    <h5>If you ever need to move items quickly, use the 1-9 number keys or use shift click. If you need to move more than 1 stack of items, take 1 item, shift click on the same type of item, and shift click twice. This will send every same item to where you want it to go. Axes deal lots of damage early game, so you should probably use them. Diamonds are found at y=-58 in the Overworld, and can be hard to find. Ancient debris, the precursor to netherite, is found in the Nether at y=15. At this point I should tell you what these y-coordinates are. If you press F3 on your keyboard, a lot of things will show up. This is a menu where you can find things like debugging, block and liquid information, and most importantly, coordinates. These are helpful when locating your lost items or going to a lost friend. They are commonly used to mark areas like your house or something cool that you found like an ocean monument or resources like a desert. <h5>
